# Collaborative Filtering Movie Recommendation System

Collaborative filtering is a powerful technique for generating personalized movie recommendations by analyzing user-item interactions and similarities between users. In this guide, we will leverage cosine similarity to compute similarities between movies based on user ratings, enabling us to provide relevant and tailored recommendations to users.

For detailed instructions and explanations, please refer to the following sections:

## Introduction to Cosine Similarity

**Cosine Similarity:** Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure the similarity between two vectors by calculating the cosine of the angle between them. In the context of collaborative filtering, cosine similarity is utilized to compute the similarity between movies based on user ratings, allowing us to identify similar movies for recommendation.
